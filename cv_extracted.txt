Vittorio Guida
Curriculum Vitae
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Trento working in behavioral and experimental economics,
mainly on sustainability, intergenerational resource management, and organizational and financial decision-
making. I use laboratory and online experiments, data analysis in R and Python, and, in recent work, AI
tools within experiments to study how decision support affects investors’ behaviour. I value collaborative,
interdisciplinary research environments, where the workplace is a community of shared learning.
